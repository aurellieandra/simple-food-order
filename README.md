# simple-food-order-app

This is a simple food order app project that used ReactJs. This code was adapted from a course practice project, which I made a few modifications to improve its functionality.

This project consists of the usage of Hooks, such as useState, useReducer, useContext, useRef, and useEffect.

Aside from that, this project uses Firebase Real-time Database.

There are a few features in this app, such as:

-   Adding meals to the cart
-   Removing meals from the cart
-   React Portal for overlays (such as backdrops, modal)
-   Viewing meals in the cart
-   etc.

This is a practice project from a course in Udemy, "React - the Complete Guide 2023 (incl. React Router & Redux)" by Maximilian Schwarzum√ºller (https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)
